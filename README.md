# IMDB Movie Analysis
## Project Details
This repository contains the Week 15 project for WsCube Tech's Data Analytics Program. The goal of this project is to explore and analyze the IMDB Movies dataset to answer business questions, identify trends, and provide actionable insights to IMDB. Using Python and libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the analysis focuses on genre popularity, rating trends, and factors influencing movie success.

## Objective
To explore the IMDB Movies dataset and perform descriptive and inferential analyses to:

- Understand genre popularity.
- Analyze rating trends.
- Identify factors influencing movie success.
## Analysis Steps
### 1. Project Setup and Data Loading
- Identify and import necessary libraries.
- Load the dataset and review its shape, rows, and columns.
### 2. Data Overview and Basic Exploration
- Use .info() to check data types and missing values.
- Utilize .describe() to summarize numerical columns and their distributions.
### 3. Data Cleaning
- Handle missing values and convert data types where necessary.
- Address outliers for better analysis.
### 4. Univariate Analysis
- Analyze individual variables such as runtimes and genres.
- Visualize distributions using histograms and bar charts.
### 5. Bivariate Analysis
- Explore relationships between pairs of variables (e.g., runtime vs. ratings).
- Use scatter plots, box plots, and correlation analysis to uncover trends.
### 6. Genre-Specific Analysis
- Analyze average ratings, popularity over time, and runtime trends across genres.
- Visualize findings using plots and charts.
### 7. Year and Trend Analysis
- Study trends in ratings, releases, and runtimes over time.
- Identify years with the highest and lowest movie releases.
### 8. Multivariate Analysis
- Explore complex relationships involving multiple variables, such as runtime, ratings, and votes.
- Use heatmaps and pair plots for visualization.
### 9. Insights and Summary
- Summarize key findings related to movie trends, popular genres, and ratings.
- Suggest additional analyses and data requirements for deeper insights.
